title: "AI Personal Trainer [Research Paper](https://cheung0.github.io/files/AI Personal Trainer Research.pdf)"
excerpt: "Research abstract: Regular physical exercise is crucial for health and wellness, but performing exercise with incorrect form can cause injuries. This paper presents a machine learning-based method to classify the quality of squats. Using an iPhone to record exercise, the videos are processed using Google's Mediapipe, which extracts x, y, z coordinates of body joints. These coordinates are then converted into joint angles, in particular, the knees and hips. A deep neural network analyzes these angles to classify and predict the quality of the squat form, offering a solution to improve exercise safety and effectiveness. <br/><img src='/images/image2.png'>"
