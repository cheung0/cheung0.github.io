Hello! My name is Michael.

I'm a Computer Science grad from San Jose State University. I've worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services and VMware. I'v also taught coding at theCoderSchool.
I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Particularly for improving our lives. For example, I built a machine learning model that predicts exercise quality. But I've also made several other less serious projects for my own use. Such as predicting Bay Area car prices or the air quality.

My hobbies include working out and learning new things. Lately that's been artificial intelligence.
