Hello! I'm a Computer Science new grad from San Jose State University. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) Web Services and [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).

I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence for improving our lives. For example, I built and did research on [AI Personal Trainer](https://cheung0.github.io/files/AI Personal Trainer Research.pdf), a computer vision model that predicts exercise quality. In addition, I worked with multimodal AI at the [UC Berkeley Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/style-sync?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress) and built a clothing recommendations app. 

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Especially in systems that are beneficial or useful to society. 

My hobbies include working out and learning.

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach me on linkedin.
