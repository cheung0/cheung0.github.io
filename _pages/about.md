Hello! I'm a Computer Science grad from San Jose State University. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) Web Services and [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).

I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Particularly for improving our lives. For example, I built a machine learning model that predicts exercise quality. I worked with AI agents and multimodal AI at the [UC Berkeley AI Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/style-sync?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress). But I've also made several other less serious projects for my own use. Such as predicting Bay Area car prices or the air quality.

My hobbies include working out and learning new things.
