Hello! I’m a Computer Science new grad from San Jose State University. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) Web Services and [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).

I’m interested in using technology for improving our lives. Here are 3 projects I’ve recently worked on: 
1. I built a waste classification app that tells you which bin your item belongs in. You can try it on mobile at: [snapgreen.onrender.com](https://snapgreen.onrender.com/). 
2. I built a clothing recommendations app at the [UC Berkeley Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/style-sync?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress).
3. I built and did research on [AI Personal Trainer](https://cheung0.github.io/files/AI Personal Trainer Research.pdf), a computer vision model that predicts exercise squat quality. 

My interests include software engineering and machine learning. Especially in systems that are beneficial or useful to society.

My hobbies include working out and learning.

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out.
