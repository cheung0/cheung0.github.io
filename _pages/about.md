Hello! I'm a Computer Science grad from San Jose State University. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) Web Services and [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).

I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Particularly for improving our lives. For example, I built a machine learning model that predicts exercise quality. I worked with AI agents and multimodal AI at the [UC Berkeley AI Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/style-sync?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress).

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Especially in systems that are beneficial or useful to society.

My hobbies include working out and learning new things. 

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach me on linkedin.
